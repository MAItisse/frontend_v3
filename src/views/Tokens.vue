        <h1>Tokens</h1>
        <p>We currently do not track tokens other than to have them in the system.</p>
        <p>So that means you can go very far negative and this is completely fine.</p>
        <p>However there is a way you can get more tokens, this is currently through twitch channel point redemptions.</p>
